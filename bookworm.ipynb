    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

Create a set of intents (at least 3) that capture the different kinds of questions that you want the system to answer, e.g. _who_, _what_ and _where_. Along with each intent, add a list of user examples or _utterances_ that map to that intent.\n",
